# Push-Swap
Stack sorting algorithm
## Description
The goal of this project is:

Having two stack, coding an algorithm that sorts a stack of numbers in the least amount of moves possible, having a restricted amount of moves available:
1. pb - Push from stack a to b
2. pa - Push from stack b to a
3. ra - Rotate stack a
4. rb - Rotate stack b
5. rr - Rotate both stacks
6. rra - Reverse rotate stack a
7. rrb - Reverse rotate stack b
8. rrr - Reverse rotate both stacks
9. sa - Swap two top numbers in stack a
10. sb - Swap two top numbers in stack b
11. ss - Swap both top numbers in stacks

The bonus part is a checker. It takes a list of numbers as an argument and reads from the stdin a list of moves to apply to the stacks. At the end it displays if the stack was sorted or not

The educational purpose of this project is learning algorithms complexity, parsing and error handling
